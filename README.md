How it works
--------

This is a simple program written in kotlin using tornadofx.

To make the program work, the user must specify the name and number of his coins in the "input.txt" file.
With this information, the program calculates the user's balance using the website "https://coinmarketcap.com/".

As build management automation tool gradle is used in this project.
